- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Chiashi Yang - The methods we decided to overload for each subclass were the constructors because this allows for a specific building to be initialized differently based on the parameters provided. Thus, making the initialization process more flexible. The CampusMap worked well, as we were able to initialize different buildings. In addition, overloading the constructors worked well. With this assignment, I was still having trouble with when to implement super and when not to. I think with practice I will know when to use it. Some advice I would give to someone taking this course in the future is to ask questions and start the assignment early!
