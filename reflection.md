Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Chiashi Yang - The methods we decided to overload for each subclass were the constructors because this allows for a specific building to be initialized differently based on the parameters provided. Thus, making the initialization process more flexible. The CampusMap worked well, as we were able to initialize different buildings. In addition, overloading the constructors worked well. With this assignment, I was still having trouble with when to implement super and when not to. I think with practice I will know when to use it. Some advice I would give to someone taking this course in the future is to ask questions and start the assignment early!

Kiara Sunil Singh - The methods we decided to overload were the constructor methods. This is because each building is different and serves a different purpose, thus, to ensure that each building was being initialized correctly we overloaded them for each subclass depending on what parameters were needed. Overall, I found overriding and overloading to be very useful because they allow for reusability of code while also making it more flexible. This saves a lot of time and duplicate code. Initially, I found this a little hard to understand because I wasnâ€™t used to altering the code in a method, but after some practice it makes a lot more sense. I would recommend that future students work with others and use TA hours as resources to help better understand the assignment.
